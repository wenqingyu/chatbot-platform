           Chatterbot: Machine learning in Python
        
        ChatterBot
        ==========
        
        ChatterBot is a machine-learning based conversational dialog engine
        build in Python which makes it possible to generate responses based on
        collections of known conversations. The language independent design of
        ChatterBot allows it to be trained to speak any language.

        An example of typical input would be something like this:
        
            | **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?
            | **bot:** I am doing very well, thank you for asking.
            | **user:** You're welcome.
            | **bot:** Do you like hats?
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        An untrained instance of ChatterBot starts off with no knowledge of how
        to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, the library saves
        the text that they entered and the text that the statement was in
        response to. As ChatterBot receives more input the number of responses
        that it can reply and the accuracy of each response in relation to the
        input statement increase. The program selects the closest matching
        response by searching for the closest matching known statement that
        matches the input, it then returns the most likely response to that
        statement based on how frequently each response is issued by the people
        the bot communicates with.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package can be installed from
        `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ChatterBot>`__ by running:
        
        ::
        
            pip install chatterbot
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        
        ::
        
            from chatterbot import ChatBot
            chatbot = ChatBot("Ron Obvious")
        
            # Train based on the english corpus
            chatbot.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")
        
            # Get a response to an input statement
            chatbot.get_response("Hello, how are you today?")
        
        Training data
        =============
        
        Chatterbot comes with a data utility module that can be used to train
        chat bots. At the moment there is two languages, English and Portuguese
        training data in this module. Contributions of additional training data
        or training data in other languages would be greatly appreciated. Take a
        look at the data files in the
        `chatterbot/corpus <https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/tree/master/chatterbot/corpus>`__
        directory if you are interested in contributing.
        
        ::
        
            # Train based on the english corpus
            chatbot.train("chatterbot.corpus.english")
        
            # Train based on english greetings corpus
            chatbot.train("chatterbot.corpus.english.greetings")
        
            # Train based on the english conversations corpus
            chatbot.train("chatterbot.corpus.english.conversations")
